### Hi, I'm Brianna Steele 
‚Äî an emerging cybersecurity and IT support professional with a foundation in full-stack web development. I'm currently based in the Capital Region/DMV area and passionate about building, breaking, and securing systems.

üõ†Ô∏è I started as a web developer, where I learned to love the problem-solving process across front-end and back-end stacks. Now, I'm combining that builder mindset with my pursuit of cybersecurity and technical support by developing hands-on labs in Azure, simulating real-world Tier 1 Help Desk and SOC environments.

üîê My recent projects include:
- A fully documented Azure-based Tier 1 Help Desk lab with AD, GPOs, and simulated tickets
- Security-focused scripting and troubleshooting in PowerShell and Windows Server
- Continuous learning in network fundamentals, threat response, and endpoint protection

Always building. Always learning. Always secure.
